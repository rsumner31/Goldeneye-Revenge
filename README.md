# Goldeneye Revenge by Callum Taylor 2012

## About
Goldeneye revenge was a College project for Games Development. We were taught to use Dark Basic to make our game, but because I saw this as the perfect opportunity to learn C++, I created my game in C++.

The game wasn't finished because I had the chance to finish college early which allowed me to go full time earlier at my job at 3 SIDED CUBE.

## Code
The code is by NO means good. It was something I hacked together in a matter of a couple of months. I had absolutely no concept of how games/models really worked so I just did everything as I went. 

The game has controller support using XINPUT and should work with most controllers, but I only tested with an XBOX 360 controller.

Because I suck at modelling, the models used were downloaded for misc websites which were then manipulated a little to do what I needed them to.

Collision detection was the hardest part about the game, as I didn't fully understand how to interact with the maps, I left it out.

## Sound
It was surprisingly hard to find a good sound library, so I ended up using OpenAL (which absolutely sucks) and so the game will most likely have no sound.

## Playing
The repository has a folder called "game" which contains the executable to play the game. You can't really do much so don't get too excited.
